📦 Inventory / Resource Management System (Backend)

A backend-first **Inventory & Resource Management System**, designed to be **domain-flexible** and reusable across different resource-based use cases (inventory, supplies, assets, etc.).

The project focuses on **core backend engineering concerns** such as authorization, business rules, scalability, operational safety, and predictable error handling.

---

## Why This Project?

Inventory and resource tracking is a common backend problem across many domains.

This project focuses on solving **backend-level challenges** that appear in most inventory systems:
- enforcing access control at the API level
- preventing unsafe or partial updates
- maintaining consistent state with soft deletes
- providing operational visibility via analytics
- designing scalable read and write patterns

The goal is not to model a single domain, but to build a **reusable backend foundation** that can adapt to different workflows with minimal changes.

## Tech Stack (V1.2)

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB Atlas
- Mongoose

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT (short-lived access tokens)
- Stateless authentication
- Role-based access control (`admin`, `volunteer`)
- Field-level authorization inside controllers

### Tooling
- dotenv
- nodemon
- Git & GitHub

## Implemented Features

### Inventory Management
- Create inventory items (admin only)
- Safe PATCH updates using allow-list strategy
- Field-level authorization based on role
- Soft delete (`isDeleted`)
- Query middleware excludes deleted items globally

---

### Inventory Listing (Scalable APIs)
- Pagination (`page`, `limit`)
- Server-side filtering:
  - category
  - low stock items
  - expiring items (N days)
- Server-side sorting (controlled allow-list)
- Defensive defaults and maximum limits

Endpoint:
GET /api/inventory

---

### Inventory Analytics (Admin Only)
- Total inventory item count
- Low stock item count
- Expiring-soon item count (next 7 days)
- Category-wise inventory breakdown
- Implemented using aggregation queries

Endpoint:
GET /api/inventory/analytics

---

### Background Jobs (Async Processing)
- Cron-based background job using `node-cron`
- Runs independently of HTTP requests
- Daily checks for:
  - low stock items
  - expiring items (next 7 days)
- Alerts currently logged (no email/SMS integration)

Purpose:
- Keeps request-response cycle lightweight
- Demonstrates async backend workflows

---

### Operational Endpoints

#### Health Check
GET /health

- Returns service status, uptime, and timestamp
- No authentication required
- Used for operational monitoring and deployment readiness

---

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based login
- Short-lived access tokens
- Protected routes
- Role-based access enforcement
- Role-aware error responses

---

### Global Error Handling
- Centralized global error handler
- Custom `AppError` class
- Async controller wrapper
- No try/catch blocks inside controllers
- Consistent error response format

---

## Environment Variables

PORT=3000
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/<dbname>
JWT_SECRET=your_secret
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=15m

---

## Testing

### Auth Regression Tests
- A minimal Jest + Supertest suite protects authentication and authorization invariants, including password hashing, role enforcement, and protected routes.

- Manual testing (intentional)
- Verified flows:
  - authentication & authorization
  - inventory CRUD
  - pagination, filtering, and sorting
  - admin analytics
  - background job execution
  - soft-delete edge cases
  - health check endpoint


---

## Not Implemented Yet (Intentional)

- Audit log persistence
- Automated tests
- Frontend integration
- Cloud deployment
- TypeScript migration

---

## Status

✅ **Backend V1.2 Stable**  
Phase 1 completed: scalable APIs, analytics, background jobs, and operational hardening.
